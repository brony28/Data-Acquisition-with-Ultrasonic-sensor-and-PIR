# Data-Acquisition-with-Ultrasonic-sensor-and-PIR
This project measures the real-world conditions (temperature/distance readings) and converts the sample into digital representation. Using  DAQ, the reading was plotted together on the graphical plotter. Sensors used: Ultrasonic and PIR, Software used: Arduino
